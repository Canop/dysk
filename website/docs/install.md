[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Canop/dysk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


# Precompiled binaries

Binaries are made available at every release in [download](https://dystroy.org/dysk/download).

The archives also contain dysk's man page and shell completion scripts.

You may download previous releases on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Canop/dysk/releases).

When you download executable files, you'll have to ensure the shell can find them. An easy solution is for example to put them in `/usr/local/bin`. You may also have to set them executable using `chmod +x dysk`.

# From crates.io

You'll need to have the [Rust development environment](https://www.rustup.rs) installed and up to date.

Once it's installed, use cargo to install dysk:

    cargo install --locked dysk

!!! Note
	If there's a compilation error, it most often means either that you're missing some compilation dependency (on ubuntu/debian try `sudo apt install build-essential`) or that you have an old version of the compiler, and you should update it (for example with `rustup update`).

# From source

You'll need to have the [Rust development environment](https://www.rustup.rs) installed.

Fetch the [Canop/dysk](https://github.com/Canop/dysk) repository, move to the dysk directory, then run

```bash
cargo install --locked --path .
```

# Third party repositories

Those packages are maintained by third parties and may be less up to date.
